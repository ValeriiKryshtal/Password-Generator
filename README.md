# Password-Generator
##Description
The goal of this project was to create a webpage that generates a randomized password using supplied index and CSS files. The page relies on Javascript to execute a number of different functions to generate a password customized to the parameters of what the user chooses.

##Installation
All functionality of this project is contained within the deployed webpage itself. Users can navigate to the following address to experience the project: 
https://valeriikryshtal.github.io/Password-Generator/

##Usage
When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button they will be prompted for how long they want the password to be. Next, they will be asked to confirm if they want to include any of the following as part of their password:
* Lowercase letters
* Uppercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters

After all choices have been made, a random password with at least one of each chosen character type will be generated and presented to the user in the main window.
